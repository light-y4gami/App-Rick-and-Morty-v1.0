# RickAndMorty

# ¿What is this project?

The Rick and Morty API is a REST(ish) and GraphQL API based on the Rick and Morty TV show.
You will have access to hundreds of characters, images, places and episodes.
The Rick and Morty API is full of canonical information as seen on the TV show.

This project is built in Angular and consumes the Rick and Morty API.
I had a lot of fun and learned a lot of things like some of the structural directives *ngFor, *ngIf,
ngClass, property bindings, etc.
This WebApp gathers information about the Rick and Morty series, such as characters, names, episodes,
locations, and much more.
It is important to learn to program while developing projects, it is essential to develop practical
skills, apply theoretical knowledge,
build a portfolio of work and improve your problem solving skills. Plus, it's a rewarding way to learn
and encourages you to keep growing as a programmer.

# ¿Who I am?

Hello, my name is Light Yagami, obviously it's not my real name,
it's just a pseudonym I took from my favorite Anime,
I'm from the Dominican Republic and I'm learning frontend development in a self-taught way and for
efficient learning I build projects.
My goal in programming is to become an excellent software engineer, and I work very hard to achieve
this.
I am currently learning Angular, at first as usual I was intimidated as I had only worked with Html, Css
and JavaScript.
It is normal to feel afraid when leaving the comfort zone, so you already know.
